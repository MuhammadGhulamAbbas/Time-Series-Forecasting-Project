# Time-Series-Forecasting-Project

This project explores time series forecasting on two datasets from the Machine Learning Repository:

A univariate dataset (time + KPI).

A multivariate dataset (time + KPI + additional variables).

We applied Exponential Smoothing, AR, MA, ARIMA, and SARIMA models to each dataset, focusing on in-sample fits, out-of-sample forecasts, and multi-step future predictions. Preprocessing included stationarity checks and differencing where needed.

The results compare the models' accuracy, efficiency, and applicability for univariate and multivariate time series, offering valuable insights into their strengths and limitations.
